# Iris Dataset - Statistical Analysis & Visualization

This project performs statistical analysis and data visualization on the famous Iris dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It was created as part of Q2 Practical for foundational data analysis practice.

## 📌 Objectives:
- Load the built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- Convert it into a structured pandas DataFrame
- Perform basic statistical operations:
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation
  - Standard Error and Covariance
- Visualize feature correlation using heatmap

## 🔧 Libraries Used:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn (for dataset)

## 📊 Techniques Covered:
- `df.mean()`, `df.mode()`, `df.median()`, `df.std()`, `df.sem()` for statistics
- `.cov()` for covariance
- `sns.heatmap()` for correlation matrix

## 📁 Dataset:
- `load_iris()` from `sklearn.datasets`

## ✅ Outcome:
Gained statistical insights from the Iris dataset and visualized relationships between features. This analysis builds intuition for feature selection and model design in future ML tasks.
